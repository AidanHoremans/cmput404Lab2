Q1:
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
or alternatively



Q2:
There really isn't that big of a difference. We instantiate both the server and client socket the same way,
the only difference is what we do with it.

The server socket will bind to an IP and a port address (i.e. serverSock.bind((HOST, PORT))) so that it can grab any incoming traffic for that port.

Alternatively the client socket is used in order to route to the 
desired server port (i.e. with clientSock.connect((host, port)) where the host and port are that of the server such as host = "www.google.com" and port = 80 for client.py)

Q3:
We can use the flag SO_REUSEADDR in setsockopt, such as with serverSock.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1).

Q4:
We get the connecting IP and the port they are coming from.

Q5:
recv recieves a set number of bytes from the socket, so for the echo example. we are recieving whatever is echoed from the client to the server,
so we get this echo value in a set number of bytes and send it back to the client
